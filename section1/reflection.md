## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I resonated with learning as a process and having a growth mindset. I love improving at a task and when I am not studying I can often be found in team activities, like sports and gaming, practicing my craft. I also love coaching in these environments and I have noticed that it does make me a better player by teaching others. I also value self care activities such as breaks, having a healthy diet, exercising and reading, but I have a bad habit where when time is at a premium, I stop spending any of it at all on these things. What I have found is when I don't make time for these things, I end up taking time for it anyways. If there is one thing I would add, super learners definitely know when and how to ask for help. Knowing what you don't know is a skill I have seen in all the best super learners.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

The hashtag # is used to indicate comments in a ruby file.

A float is an integer with a decimal point. It is used when more precise numbers are needed.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

```

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

```ruby

```

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation allows you to put a variable result of code in the middle of a string.
```ruby
puts "I once went on safari and saw a #{animal}"
```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

```ruby

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

.sub is used to replace part of a string with another part, but only in a single instance.
Ex:
'''
greeting.sub("World!","Local!")
'''

.split is used to split a string on a space or any other defined break.
Ex:
```
greeting.split
=> "Hello, World!"
```
