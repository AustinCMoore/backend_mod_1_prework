# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/numbers.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints the result of the sum of 2 and 2:
puts "What do I get if I add 2 and 2?"
puts 2 + 2 #Should return 4

# Write code that prints the result of 7 subtracted from 83:
puts "What is 83 - 7? #{83 - 7}" #Should return 76

# Write code that prints the result of 6 multiplied by 53:
puts "6 times 53 is #{6 * 53}" #Should return 318

# Write code that prints the result of the modulo of 10 into 54:
puts 54 % 10 #Should return 4
