# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/strings.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints your name to the terminal:
puts "Austin Moore"

# Write code that prints `Welcome to Turing!` to the terminal:
prints "Welcome to Turing!\n"

# Write code that prints `99 bottles of pop on the wall...` to the terminal:
bottles_on_wall = 99 #Creates variable for bottles with initial value of 99
puts "#{bottles_on_wall} bottles of pop on the wall, #{bottles_on_wall} of pop!"
puts "Take one down, pass it around..."
bottles_on_wall = bottles_on_wall - 1
puts "#{bottles_on_wall} of pop on the wall!" #At this point I realized Loops is exercise 6 and this isn't what we're being asked

# Write out code to log one line from your favorite song or movie.
puts "You keep using that word, I do not think you know what it means." #Princess Bride!
