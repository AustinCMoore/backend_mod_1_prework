## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I felt fresh and focused during my study sessions, and sometimes would end on a problem but come back from a break catching something I had missed.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I actually, for the first time ever, overestimated how long things would take and found myself with a ton of free time!

3. In your own words, what is a Class?

A class contains some paramaters and instance variables that are relevant to a certain "topic"

4. What is an attribute of a Class?

The variables

5. What is behavior of a Class?

the methods

6. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```ruby
class dog
  def initialize(name, color)
    @name = name
    @color = color
  end

  def speak
    puts "bark!"
  end

  def sit
    puts "-sits-"
  end
end
```

7. How do you create an instance of a class?

```ruby
initialize
```

8. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?

I think I may be mixing up some vocabulary, but certain terms are used interchangebly online.
